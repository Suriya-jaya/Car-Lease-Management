# Car-Lease-Management
Trimble Cars is a Spring Boot-based backend application that allows car owners to lease their vehicles and customers to rent them. Admins have full access to manage users, cars, and leases. The application uses in-memory H2 for simplicity and exposes RESTful APIs for managing the complete lease lifecycle.
